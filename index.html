            I am a web development student located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. While I am taking classes with the UNC Coding Bootcamp, I am continuing to work at UNC Student Stores Tech Shop as a Supervisor. I am studying web development with the goal of getting a full time position as a full stack web developer in the North Carolina Triangle area.

            I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with a double major in Linguistics and Asian Studies with a concentration in Japanese. I have experience working at a company in San Francisco that makes visual novel games for iOS and Android phones. In addition, I have experience with tutoring and classroom teaching. I believe that my unique background and varied skills will make me a great addition to a software development team.
