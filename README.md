# Katie's Portfolio

## Description 

This portfolio was created using HTML and CSS without a framework. Some of the focuses of the project was to utilize semantic HTML, CSS positioning and floats, and CSS selectors.

The project was created with the following mockups as a guide:


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the project in a text editor of your choice
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view

## Usage 

This project has three pages: "About Me", "Contact", and "Portfolio". Even though this portfolio features content specific to me, the project can be used a portfolio template. Content, such as the images and text of the HTML files can be replaced and personalized. Another way to customize this project would be to change the colors of the elements.
